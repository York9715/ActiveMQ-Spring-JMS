Java Messaging Service (JMS) is a standard messaging API used to send and receive messages.

Spring simplifies the use of JMS API by providing another layer around the JMS layer.

This layer provides convenience methods for sending and receiving messages, as well as manages the creation and release of resources like the connection object.

The JmsTemplate class is the main class which we will be using often to work with the JMS API.
